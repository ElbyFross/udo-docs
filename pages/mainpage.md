# Welcome to the Doloro Networking Framework!
Thank you for deciding to use the [Uniform Data Operator](https://github.com/ElbyFross/uniform-data-operator) at your project!


The **UDO** is a powerful framework that highly simplify managing of a cross apps data. 
Moreover using the framework standardize an in-app data architecture and prevents occurring of spaghetti-like data relations on the late stages of development.
The one of the core features is automatization of data exchange between client applications and **SQL** servers.

Still the tend to standardized work process not cause a lack of free space for a developer. 
A main rule of the **UDO** is never force the developer to use the built-in API as an only way to managing a data, 
because as an any stantartized API it has a lack of features for uncommon cases.
